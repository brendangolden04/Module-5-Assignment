# Module-5-Assignment
This is my repository for Assignment 5
In this module I learned about classes and objects and really figured out how to debug my work. I was having a lot of trouble with the code and it wasn't working correclty and then I started learning how to really debug well, and it helped me tremendously in figuring out the problems and how to fix it.
